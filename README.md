# cool-site
A cool site using React and its fundamentals, with not a lot of styling but just enough to have a pleasant effect.. 

Added routing, element adders as well as deleters, added normal api call interactions,
api calls according to user input, user interactvity, currently working on 
implementing a quiz system( i have almost 50% of the logic laid out, will do the rest
gradually), and more...

I will add new features herein..like i wanna add a navbar that has like options displaying
the various routes that we can go to, a dark-light toggler maybe, a footer describing me
and my various profiles, the quiz system as i have already mentioned before and a lot more.
I will keep adding features and functionalities in the future as well..

Last but not the least, React is so much fun to work with! I ran into so many issues and 
challenges while i was building this site but through thinking (and a bit of googling), 
i managed to solve everything and build out the site perfectly.
